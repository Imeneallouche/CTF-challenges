<p align="center"> 
Morse Code is a code that was created in 1832, and which allow to transmit data via short
and long impulsions. The paternity of Morse Code is often assigned to Samuel Morse, though
this is considered as controversial. The advantage of the Morse Code lies in its simplicity
and its universality. In fact the impulsions that allows the data to be transmitted could be 
sound signals, light signals, visual, analogic, or even numeric.You could transmit data with
every way that allow you to produce recognizable impulsions.

<p align="cneter"> The Code Morse principle is actually very simple, it assigns to each symbol (letters, numbers,
and some special characters) a value constituted by dots for short impulsions, and by dashes for 
long impulsions. That way you "just" have to know all the Morse alphabet "by-heart" to decode any
message that was coded using Morse code. You can note that we usually add a "/" sign between each
word when reading a Morse Code phrase. For instance the two words "MORSE CODE" would be coded 
this way : -- --- .-. ... . / -.-. --- -.. .
