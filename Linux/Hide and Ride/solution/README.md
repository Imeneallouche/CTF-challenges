<h1 align='center'>Hide and Ride Solution</h1>

<p> The solution is pretty much easy, there is what we call hidden files and directories in Linux, they are all anticipated with a dot in their names</p>
<p>in order to see all the files and directories (the hidden and the none hidden ones) we can type the command:</p>

```yaml
ls -a
cat .flag.txt
```

<p>and here you get the flag: </p>

```yaml
shellmates{N0!_I_w4S_Pr3tty_SuR3_I_hld_W3ll}
```
